# Setup
This will allow you to run the project locally:

+ Install gulp globally with `npm install -g gulp`
+ Cd into project root. All consoles should be at project root (`/frrapp`)
+ Install project dependencies with `npm install`
+ In one console, type `gulp sparrest` to run the backend API that will serve dynamic content (comments)
+ Go to `www` and `drag-and-drop` `index.html` into your browser. It will run from there.
